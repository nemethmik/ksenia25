# ðŸš€ Welcome to your new awesome project ksenia25

A single-page web application built with webpack and typescript.
The project fancy name is coming from Ksenia Smirnova Russian volleyball player with number 25.

This a regular webpack application project without any fancy framework like Angular or React. I love both Angular and React, but this time this project is just using regular tools like webpack, typescript, HTML, CSS, bootstrap, web components.

## Project Scaffolding
This project has been created using **webpack-cli init**, you have the following commands:
- **npm run serve** to run the development server
- **npm run build** to build a production bundle in the **dist** folder.
    - This is not really needed since GitHub deployment workflow will build it for us when deploying the app onto Azure as a static web app.

## Adding Bootrap
- npm i bootstrap popper bootstrap-icons
- npm i -D @types/bootstrap
